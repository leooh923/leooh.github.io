             <li> I have graduated from Rice University with a degree in Mathematical Economic analysis and Sport Management. I was mainly interested in the intersection between those two subjects which led me to doing my thesis on investigating whether players learn under a game theoretic framework </li>
             <li> I decided to pursue a Master's degree in Statistics in A&M because I am mainly interested in Bayesian Statistics. I saw that many members of the faculty were experts within Bayesian Statistics, so I was interested in doing a thesis under one of them. </li>
